C++ code to read out EICRECON data and produce output files containing for each Q2, xB, z bin the number of hadrons for spin up (U) and spin down (D) as well as values of kin. variables.

Each event is weighted according to a cross section calculated at NLO based on
NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118 and DSSV FFs: Phys.Rev.Lett.101:072001,2008

EICRECON data:
root://dtn-eic.jlab.org//volatile/eic/EPIC/RECO/25.08.0/epic_craterlake/DIS/NC/18x275/minQ2=*/pythia8NCDIS_18x275_minQ2=*_beamEffects_xAngle=-0.025_hiDiv_1.0000.eicrecon.edm4eic.root

with *=1, 10, 100, 1000

dis.cc:
depolarisation value set to 1 for the calculation of the systematic uncertainty
(Avoids too large fluctuations given the limited available simulation data.)

To run:
./submit_e18p275_Q1.sh runlist.txt
with runlist: list of EICRECON data.

PID is 211 or 321

Scripts to run on condor for minQ1 are provided.
For other minQ, adjust accordingly.
