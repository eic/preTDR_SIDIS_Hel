sumlum.C:
combines all minQ data.


plot_asymPub.C 
prints out:
-) reconstructed asymmetry, stat. unc., sys. unc., average of kinematic variables
-) 'unfolded' asymmetry, stat. unc., sys. unc., average of kinematic variables,
    where 'unfolded' asymmetry = the generated asymmetry
With sys. unc.= difference between reconstructed and generated asymmetry.
The limited available MC statistics does suffer from fluctuations, which enhance the sys. unc. for various bins.

plots:
the reconstructed and generated asymmetry.

plot_asymPubwithout.C: same as plot_asymPub.C but for depol=1.

plot_sysPub.C
plots the preTDR plot sysPub_18x275_poskaons.pdf based on the output from the scripts above.
Plot shows for a selection of zbins and Q^2 bins, the stat. and total uncertainty as a function of xB.
